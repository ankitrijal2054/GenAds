# Product Context — AI Ad Video Generator (Luxury Perfume Specialist)

**Version 2.0 - Refactored for Luxury Perfume TikTok Ads**

---

## The Problem Space (REFINED FOR PERFUME NICHE)

### Why Luxury Perfume Brands Need Specialized Tools

**Existing generic AI tools fail for perfume advertising because:**

1. **No Understanding of Perfume Visual Language**
   - Generic AI doesn't know perfume shot grammar
   - Produces random scenes (product demos, people talking, generic b-roll)
   - Missing: Macro bottle shots, atmospheric lighting, luxury materials
   - Result: Videos don't "feel like" perfume ads

2. **Can't Maintain Luxury Aesthetic**
   - Freeform LLM generation = inconsistent style
   - One scene dark/moody, next scene bright/colorful
   - No theme consistency across video
   - Result: Looks amateurish, not high-end

3. **Ignores Brand Identity**
   - Can't respect brand guidelines (colors, tone, dos/donts)
   - User style preferences get ignored
   - Reference image inspiration not applied consistently
   - Result: Off-brand, can't use professionally

4. **Wrong Platform Optimization**
   - Tools default to horizontal (16:9)
   - TikTok vertical (9:16) is afterthought
   - Text positioning wrong for mobile UI
   - Result: Crops badly, UI elements covered

### Market Opportunity (PERFUME NICHE)

- **Perfume market:** $65B globally, growing 5-7% yearly
- **TikTok dominance:** #1 platform for perfume discovery (Gen Z/Millennial)
- **Ad volume need:** Brands test 10-50 variations per campaign
- **Current cost:** $5K-50K per 30s ad, 2-4 weeks turnaround
- **Agency bottleneck:** Can't iterate fast enough for TikTok's pace

**Gap:** No AI tool specializes in luxury perfume TikTok ads with consistent brand elegance and proper shot grammar.

### Next-Generation Feature: Multi-Variation Generation (Nov 18, 2025)

Users can now generate 1-3 variations per request:
- **Purpose:** Let users compare different creative approaches on the fly
- **UX:** Select variation count upfront (1, 2, or 3)
- **Experience:** Side-by-side preview of variations, pick favorite
- **Performance:** Parallel generation = 3 variations in same time as 1!
- **Variation types:** Cinematic (dramatic), Minimal (clean), Lifestyle (atmospheric)
- **Result:** Users get options, not forced into single creative direction

This is a pure user experience enhancement - leverages existing infrastructure, adds intelligent variation at scene-planning level.

## Our Solution (PERFUME-SPECIALIZED)

### 1. Constrained-Creative AI (NEW)

**The Insight:** LLM creativity WITHIN perfume shot grammar constraints.

**Traditional Approach (BAD):**
```
User Brief → LLM generates any scenes → Random, non-perfume results ❌
```

**Our Approach (GOOD):**
```
1. Load Perfume Shot Grammar (5 categories, 30+ variations)
2. LLM generates scenes BUT MUST use allowed shot types
3. Validate: All scenes follow grammar? Style consistent?
4. If fails → Retry 3x → Use predefined template
   → Creative scenes that always look "perfume-like" ✓
```

**5 Allowed Shot Categories:**
- **Macro Bottle Shots:** Extreme close-up, slow pan, spray mist
- **Luxury B-roll:** Silk fabric, roses/petals, jewelry, candle flame
- **Atmospheric Scenes:** Light rays, shadows, reflections, dust motes
- **Minimal Human Silhouettes:** Hand picking bottle, neck/shoulder, shadowed movement (optional)
- **Final Brand Moment:** Product centered, tagline, black/gold theme

### 2. Style Cascading System (NEW)

**The Insight:** Merge style inputs with clear priority hierarchy.

**Priority:**
1. **Brand Guidelines** (Highest) - Colors, tone, fonts from PDF/DOCX
2. **User Style/Prompt** (More Weight) - GOLD_LUXE, DARK_ELEGANCE, or ROMANTIC_FLORAL
3. **Reference Image** (Some Weight) - Visual inspiration

**Apply unified style to ALL scenes → Theme consistency guaranteed ✓**

### 3. Product Compositing (KEPT)

**The Insight:** Treat perfume bottle as sacred, background as variable.

```
1. Extract bottle from uploaded image (pixel-perfect)
2. Generate luxury backgrounds WITHOUT bottle
3. Composite bottle onto backgrounds with OpenCV
   → Bottle stays exactly the same ✓
```

### How It Works (User Journey)

#### 1. Input Stage
User provides:
- Creative prompt (2-3 sentences describing perfume ad vision)
- Brand name and description
- Perfume name (required, e.g., "Noir Élégance")
- Perfume gender (required: 'masculine', 'feminine', or 'unisex')
- Target audience (optional)
- Video duration (15-60s for TikTok)
- Selected style (optional: 'gold_luxe', 'dark_elegance', or 'romantic_floral')
- Product image (perfume bottle PNG/JPG)
- Brand guidelines (optional PDF/DOCX)
- Reference image (optional mood board)

#### 2. Planning Stage (Automatic)
**Scene Planner (LLM):**
- Breaks brief into 3-5 scenes:
  - Hook (2-3s) - Attention grabber
  - Product Showcase (3-5s) - Hero shot
  - Benefit Demo (4-6s) - Value prop
  - Lifestyle Context (3-5s) - Product in use
  - Call-to-Action (3-4s) - Purchase prompt

**Style Spec Generator:**
- Analyzes brief and brand
- Creates global style rules:
  - Lighting: "soft studio lighting, warm tones"
  - Camera: "smooth panning, cinematic"
  - Mood: "fresh, uplifting"
  - Colors: [brand palette]
  - Grade: "warm shadows, teal highlights"

#### 3. Generation Stage (Automatic)
**Parallel Processing:**
- All scenes generate simultaneously (4x faster)
- Each scene uses same Style Spec
- Product never mentioned in prompts

**Product Extraction:**
- Background removed with rembg
- Saves masked PNG with transparency
- Creates clean mask for compositing

**Background Videos:**
- Wān model generates each scene
- Prompts: Scene description + Style Spec
- Negative prompt: "product, logo, text, watermark"
- Output: Clean backgrounds, 3-4s each

#### 4. Compositing Stage (Automatic) - PERFUME-OPTIMIZED
**For each scene:**
- If use_product = False → Use background as-is
- If use_product = True → Overlay perfume bottle with TikTok-safe positioning

**Process (Perfume-Specific):**
1. Download background video (TikTok vertical 1080x1920)
2. Determine scale based on scene role:
   - Hook scenes: 50% of frame height
   - Showcase scenes: 60% of frame height (larger for product focus)
   - CTA scenes: 50% of frame height
3. Position in TikTok safe zone (15-75% vertical space):
   - center: Centered horizontally, centered in safe zone
   - center_upper: Centered horizontally, upper third of safe zone
   - center_lower: Centered horizontally, lower third of safe zone
4. Frame-by-frame alpha blending with OpenCV
5. Save composited video locally (not S3 until final render)

#### 5. Enhancement Stage (Automatic)
**Text Overlays:**
- FFmpeg drawtext filter
- Position based on scene role:
  - Hook: Top center
  - CTA: Bottom center
  - Benefits: Lower third
- Brand colors applied
- Fade in/out animations

**Background Music:**
- MusicGen creates luxury ambient cinematic track
- Gender-aware prompts (masculine: deep/confident, feminine: elegant/delicate, unisex: sophisticated/modern)
- Automatic gender inference from style selection or creative prompt
- Trim to exact video duration
- Normalize to -6dB
- Sync with scene transitions

#### 6. Rendering Stage (Automatic)
**TikTok Vertical Video (9:16, 1080x1920):**
- Concatenate all scenes
- Crossfade transitions (0.5s)
- Mux audio with video
- 1080x1920 resolution, 30fps, H.264
- Upload to S3

#### 7. Delivery
User receives:

### Next-Generation Feature: AI Scene Editing (January 20, 2025)

Users can now edit individual scenes in their generated videos:
- **Purpose:** Refine videos without regenerating entire campaign
- **UX:** Click "Edit Scene" → Enter prompt → Wait ~3 minutes → Video updates
- **Cost:** ~$0.21 per scene edit (only edited scene regenerated)
- **Experience:** Integrated editing from video results page (no navigation)
- **History:** Lightweight audit trail (edit count, cost, changes summary)
- **Result:** Users can iterate on specific scenes without full regeneration

This enables rapid iteration - users can refine individual scenes until perfect, rather than regenerating entire videos.

### Next-Generation Feature: Manual Video Editing (January 20, 2025 - Implementation Complete ✅)

Users can now manually edit videos using a timeline interface:
- **Purpose:** Fine-grained control over scene arrangement, trimming, and audio
- **UX:** Navigate to manual editing → Timeline loads with all scenes → Edit → Export
- **Features:** Drag-and-drop reordering, trim scenes, split scenes, adjust volume
- **Finalization:** Export sets `manual_editing_done = True`, removes draft files from S3
- **Restriction:** Once finalized, no further editing possible (prompt-based or manual)
- **Storage:** Only `final_video.mp4` remains after export (draft files cleaned up)
- **Result:** Professional video editing workflow with campaign finalization

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Timeline-based editing interface (trim, split, reorder)
- ✅ Preview playback with timeline synchronization
- ✅ Export pipeline with FFmpeg processing
- ✅ S3 cleanup after export (removes draft files)
- ✅ Database finalization flag (`manual_editing_done`)
- ✅ Frontend restrictions (hides editing if finalized)

This enables professional editing capabilities while maintaining campaign immutability after export.
